<!-- Intro: I've been knowing Chris. -->

It would be really hard to overstate how happy I am to be here seeing the union of one of my oldest friends with someone that he truly, deeply loves.
Chris and I have known one another for a long time.
He and I met in 4th grade in English class.
I remember him being introduced.
The teacher said something to the effect, "This is Chris Gerspacher. He is new to our school, and he's from Florida."
The only thought I had of him at the time was that he had a really weird last name.

This soon changed in our reading of Gary Paulsen's _Hatchet_, a story of a thirteen year old surviving alone in the wilderness of Canada.
I'd love to tell you that it was the themes of self-reliance that we bonded over.
I'd love to say that it inspired in us a practical love and respect for the outdoors.
However, it was none of that.
A huge moment in the book for our young hero was him building a fire.
He is so moved by the warmth and protection that he calls it his friend.
He is so happy to have fire to cook by, to sleep by, to warm himself by that he talks to the fire.
He tenderly says, "Hello, Fire."
Chris and I thought this was so incredibly stupid.
We howled and cried with laughter at someone talking to fire of all things.
The shared joy in laughing at this marked the inception of a now nearly two decade long friendship.

<!-- Youth: Chris (and I) sucked. -->

With such a foreshadowing show of irreverence marking the beginning of our friendship, we went on to be prototypical adolescent rascals.
In other words, we sucked for a while.
We did, however, hold a particular niche as mischief-makers.
We often were both among the worst behaved students and the best performing students.
I remember a teacher getting onto us for talking saying, "you both should be working on the packet of math problems I assigned you."
We chirped in a wry tone, "we're already done", and went back to whatever trouble we were making.

One of my favorite of all these hijinks happened again in our sophomore English class.
Despite the debt we owed the humanities for our friendship, we both (at the time) maintained that anything beside math or science was a waste of our time.
So, we were never up to any good.
We never read the assigned books.
We always talked in class.
We once made a contraption that shot paper airplanes in to the foam core drop ceilings.

An important aside, Chris and I took an American Sign Language class on a lark.
We actually achieved fluency at the time.
Though, we have both lost it at this point.

That said, we were, one day, in our least favorite class of the day, the dreaded English.
On this day, we were particularly chatty.
Mrs. Ward, our teacher, said, "Hey guys, stop talking."
We did not abide.
Again, Mrs. Ward warned, "Austin, Chris, stop talking. Others are trying to do the assignment."
We did not relent.
Finally, She sternly said, "If you two say one more word, I will eject both of you from my class."
So, rather naturally, Chris and I started conversing in fluent, albeit wordless, sign language.
This woman lost her head.
After this, she let us sit in the back of the class and gave us no trouble as long as our work was done.

<!-- Growth: Shows of character. -->

Despite our best efforts, Chris and I did slowly grow into good people.
While we were rascals, we were hard workers.
Just as I remember Chris ready to make jokes and gaffs, I remember how we would push each other to do better and study harder.
We took extra classes together.
Heck we were both _Mathletes_.

Chris got me my first job; We were dishwashers for a kitchen at an independent living facility.
It would be an understatement to say that we built alot of character working there.
The hours were long; the work was hard; the pay sucked; we worked with many _colorful_ people.
Once, while closing, the sewer system for the kitchen backed up and flooded three times.
We cleaned it up together every time.

We still pushed each other to grow.
We both became line cooks very quickly.
We would have competitions for prep speed, knife skills, and even recipe development.
We became very in tune as both friends and coworkers.
Some of my fondest memories of he and I are the wordless flows that we would get into in a dinner rush.
Chris and I would dart around one another taking orders and dishing food out manning 5 pieces of cooking equipment together.

As we grew professionally, so did we develop personally.
A kitchen is a loud place, however, a walk-in freezer is just as much insulated from sound as it is heat.
Chris always lent a kind ear to hearing my problems.
He was always a person I could confide in, and he would commiserate if not give good advice.
I hold very dear all the countless stories of Chris that I couldn't fit into this speech.
Just the same, I hold so dear the constant, deep running friendship that he and I share.
The kind of friendship that you can't put words to, but it is always there.

<!-- Falling Action: Lonely Chris. -->

Something I can confidently say about Chris, he is an odd fella.
Not _too_ odd at all.
But all the same particular.
Nevertheless, people have always found him a delight to be around.
The deep friendship I speak about is something that everyone who knows Chris knows in some capacity.
Something I saw as we grew up, people that Chris dated seemed to take this care for granted.

<!-- Climax: Enter Tori. -->

Now I haven't known Tori for seventeen years, but I've known her for five or six.
My first impression was that she was shy, yet they already meshed well together.
The whole time I've known her she's loved Chris.
More than that, she appreciates him for who he is.
When Chris is ranting about something car related, Tori listens with a patient joy of hearing someone she loves being passionate.
When I've seen them argue, it comes from a place of compassion, solving the problem together instead of fighting to win.
Over the years, I've seen their love develop.
I can't think of a trait in a partner that my friend would need that she doesn't have.

<!-- Conclusion: Why the marriage will work. -->

Bringing this all to a close, I'm so excited to see these two come together.
Moreover, I'm very hopeful for them to have a long, happy, healthy marriage.
Both people in this union are people with deep and immense care in them.
Far and away from that, these are two people who care for each other.
Watch how they look at one another.
When Chris looks at Tori, she is the only thing that he sees.
When Tori looks at Chris, she sees him -- all of him -- for all he's worth.

These two love each other.
At that they both have lots of love to give.
I think they have great times ahead of them.
