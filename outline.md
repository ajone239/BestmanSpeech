# First draft prep

- Who is the audience? (Background, interests, needs, and level of knowledge.)

    The family and friends of Chris and Tori.

    The respective friends will center around my age, so I think the tone will work out.

    Chris's family will likely be his mom, sister, and select uncles.
    They are northern and therefore crass.
    This shouldn't inform my "respectful tone", but it does mean I can shoot a good jab under the radar.

    Tori's family is southern and more conservatie.
    They are also the family of the bride, which should be respected.
    They're presence will need to be accounted for in the writing tone and style.

- What is the purpose? (Inform, persuade, entertain, inspire, or provoke action.)

    Entertain/Inspire: This speech should be funny hopecore.

- What is the central message? (One clear thesis or takeaway.)

    Chris is a great guy. Tori and Chris will have a good marriage.

- What tone? (Formal, casual, motivational, empathetic, etc.)

    Semi-formal.
    I can't be saying "cock" and "balls", but jokes will be welcomed.

- How to structure it? (Introduction, key points, conclusion—logical or thematic flow.)
    + Intro: I've been knowing Chris.
    + Youth: Chris (and I) sucked.
    + Growth: Shows of character.
    + Falling Action: Lonely Chris.
    + Climax: Enter Tori.
    + Conclusion: Why the marriage will work.

- What key examples or stories? (Relevant anecdotes, data, or analogies.)
    + Intro: I've been knowing Chris.
        * Funny last name
        * Hello Fire
    + Youth: Chris (and I) sucked.
        * Signing in Mrs. Ward's class
    + Growth: Shows of character.
        * The Dangerous Game
        * Positive Force: intellectual rivals
        * Working together: sewage, in sync, etc.
    + Falling Action: Lonely Chris.
    + Climax: Enter Tori.
    + Conclusion: Why the marriage will work.

- How to engage them? (Questions, humor, relatability, or urgency.)

    The goal is to do this with a mix of humor, tone, and story telling skill.

- Length and language? (Simple, vivid, or technical—balance clarity with impact.)

    The speech should be 3-5 minutes.
    This will shake out to about 650 words.

    The language should be casual and approachable.
