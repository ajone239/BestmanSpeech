<!--
    Things to remember:
    - no one give a heck about your stories
    - your job is to explain why Chris and Tori will work out
    - nostalgia needs to be in service of the main idea.

<!--
    Intro:
    - How Chris and I met
    - We were rascals
-->

It's hard to overstate how happy I am to be here, at this wedding, with this couple.
Chris and I have known each other for a long time.
We met in the 4th grade in English class.
<!-- VB: this next part is kind of told as a joke -->
I remember him being introduced, something like (and I'm paraphrasing here), "This is Chris Gerspacher. He is new to our school, and he's from Florida."
I remember this not because of how cool he seemed or that we hit it off right away, but because I thought that he had a *really weird last name*.
Which is something I hope Tori knew before she entered into \* waves about \* this whole thing.

[Now/At any rate/Anyway], Chris and I wouldn't become friends until a few months later.

Our class was reading Gary Paulsen's _Hatchet_: a story about about a young man marooned in the Canadian wilderness.

I wish I could tell you that we bonded over the themes of self-reliance, or the reverence for nature.
But I'm gonna be straight with you. On the up-and-up. *No cap.* <!-- VB: Maybe too jocular. -->
What spawned nearly two decades of friendship between us was how stupid we thought the main character was for talking to his fire.

<!-- VB: I would keep at least some of this; it feels too quick without it, but maybe you're pressed for time -->
This guy is *so happy* to have fire to cook by, to sleep by, to warm himself by that he calls it *his friend*.
He tenderly says, "Hello, Fire." <!-- VB: [especially this line, and then hit the "howled and cried" on the next line] -->

We howled and cried with laughter.
<!-- VB: Pause 2, 3, 4 -->
It's actually a very moving part of the book if you ever check it out.

<!--
    Why Chris is a great guy:
    - Chris works hard.
    - Chris is a good friend.
    - Chris cares.
-->

I've picked up a few things on Chris over the years.

<!-- Chris works hard. -->

Firstly, Chris knows the worth and value of hard work.
Chris is an extremely hard worker.
He is diligent.
He is meticulous.

We didn't just go to school together; we also worked together for a few years. He got me my first job.
I have never seen Chris take the easy way out.

<!-- VB: I feel like this is hitting this point pretty hard, but maybe the emphasis is intentional. You know what you're doing. -->

<!-- Chris is a good friend -->
Secondly, Chris is a tremendously loyal friend.
There hasn't been a time when I've needed Chris and he wasn't there.
He'll lend an ear to anyone's troubles and help as he can.

<!-- Chris cares. -->
The last thing I know about Chris, he has a big heart on him.
We share countless stories that I couldn't fit into this speech, stories that illuminate the constant, deep-running friendship that he and I share.
Our deep friendship isn't unique for Chris.
He seems to inspire deep connection with a lot of people.

<!--
    Enter Tori:
    - She appreciates him
        + She's one of the first examples I remember of someone really seeing Chris.
    - She deserves him
-->

I've known Tori for over half a decade and she's loved Chris from the get-go.
<!-- VB: I changed the "I remember" part because we're making statements here, not cagily testifying in court -->
More than that, she appreciates him for who he is, she really *sees* him.
When Chris is ranting about something car-related, Tori listens with a patient joy of hearing someone she loves being passionate.
When he is hard at work, she appreciates his ardor.

She loves him for his loyalty, his fervor, his unconditional love, and his companionship.
Chris really is man's best friend.
I knew that they would hit it off when I learned that Tori is a professional dog-sitter.

<!--
    Conclusion:
    - Love
    - Marriage
    - Pretty language
    - Be word man
-->

Over the years, I've seen their relationship develop and deepen.
Of course, they have love between them.
More than that, the love between them comprises all the fundamentals.
They have the dedication.
They have the compassion.
They have the mutual appreciation.
What they have will enhance the highs and dampen the lows.

These two wonderful people are already *together* but I'm so excited to help them celebrate *tying the knot*.
I know that they'll have a long, happy, and healthy marriage.
