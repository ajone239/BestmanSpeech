Preamble:

- I've been asked to say some words concerning the bride and groom.
- I wanted to say some words of commencement for Chris and Tori's wedding.
- If it so pleases the players and pimps of the court -- may I speak my peace.

<!-- Intro: I've been knowing Chris. -->

It's hard to overstate how happy I am to be here, at this particular wedding.
Chris and I have known one another for a long time.
He and I met in 4th grade in English class.

I remember him being introduced, something like (and I'm paraphrasing here [ed. this is kind of told as a joke]), "This is Chris Gerspacher. He is new to our school, and he's from Florida."
I remember this not because of how cool he seemed or that we hit it off right away, but because I thought that he had a *really weird last name*.

Things clicked when we had to read Gary Paulsen's _Hatchet_, a story of a thirteen-year-old surviving alone in the wilderness of Canada.

I'd love to tell you that it was the themes of self-reliance that we bonded over.

I'd love to say that it inspired in us a practical love and respect for the outdoors.

But I'm gonna be straight with you. On the up-and-up. *No cap.*

A huge moment in the book for our young hero was him building a fire.
He is so moved by the warmth and protection that he calls it his friend.
He is so happy to have fire to cook by, to sleep by, to warm himself by that he talks to the fire.
He tenderly says, "Hello, Fire."
Chris and I thought this was so incredibly stupid.
We howled and cried with laughter at someone talking to fire, of all things.
The shared joy in laughing at this marked the inception of a now nearly two-decade-long friendship.

<!-- Youth: Chris (and I) sucked. -->

This was the auspicious start of a friendship that would continue in this vein: we were prototypical adolescent rascals.
In other words, we sucked for a while.
We did, however, occupy a *particular* niche as mischief-makers.
That niche? Both worst-behaved *and* best-performing students.
A dream combination for any teacher.
I remember a teacher getting onto us for talking, saying, "you both should be working on the packet of math problems I assigned you."
We chirped, "we're already done", almost certainly with broad smirks on eminently punchable faces and went back to whatever trouble we were making.

One of my favorite of all these hijinks was in our sophomore English class.
Despite the debt we owed the humanities for our friendship, we both (at the time) maintained that anything beside math or science was a waste of our time.
So, we were never up to any good.
We never read the assigned books.
We always talked in class.
We once made a contraption that could *bury* paper airplanes into the drop ceilings.

We did *do* learn stuff, though!
Like, Chris and I took an American Sign Language class on a lark.
We actually achieved fluency at the time.

So, the stage is set. [Catch some eyes for approval to proceed]
One day, in our least favorite class of the day, the dreaded English.
On this day, we were particularly chatty.
Mrs. Ward, our teacher, said, "Hey guys, stop talking."
We did not abide.
Again, Mrs. Ward warned, "Austin, Chris, stop talking. Others are trying to do the assignment."
We did not relent.
Finally, She sternly said, "If you two say one more word, I will eject both of you from my class."
So, rather naturally, Chris and I started conversing in fluent, albeit wordless, sign language.
This poor woman lost her head.

<!-- Growth: Shows of character. -->

While we we infatuated with our own cleverness then, we now empathize with our poor teacher.
So Chris and I did what most people do: we slowly and reluctantly became good people.
We were rascals but hard workers.
Just as I remember Chris ready to make jokes and gaffs, I remember how we would push each other to do better and study harder.
We took extra classes together.
Heck we were both _Mathletes_.

Chris got me my first job; We were dishwashers for a kitchen at an independent-living facility.
There is a lot of opportunity for building character while working at a place like that. We took them.
The hours were long; the work was hard; the pay sucked; we worked with many _colorful_ people.
Once, while closing, the sewer system for the kitchen backed up and flooded three times.
We cleaned it up together every time.

We still pushed each other to grow.
We both became line-cooks very quickly.
We would have competitions for prep speed, knife skills, and even recipe development.
We became very in tune as both friends and coworkers.
Some of my fondest memories of us are of the wordless flows that we would get into in a dinner rush: we were a well-oiled machine, dare I say a *symphony*, of order-taking, food-serving, all while juggling myriad kitchen implements.
We learned together that any job done well could be a source of pride, learning, and improvement. [Too much?]

A kitchen is *loud*. The walk-in freezer is not.
There, Chris would lend a kind ear to my problems.
He was always a person I could confide in.
Sometimes he had advice to give; sometimes my problems allowed only empathy.
I hold very dear all the countless stories of Chris that I couldn't fit into this speech.
Just the same, I hold so dear the constant, deep-running friendship that he and I share.
The kind of friendship that you can't put words to, but it is always there.

<!-- Falling Action: Lonely Chris. -->

Our deep friendship isn't unique for Chris. He seems to inspire deep connection with a lot of people.
Something I saw as we grew up, people that Chris dated seemed to take this care for granted.

<!-- Climax: Enter Tori. -->

I've known Tori for over half a decade and, the whole time I've known her, she's loved Chris.
More than that, she appreciates him for who he is.
When Chris is ranting about something car-related, Tori listens with a patient joy of hearing someone she loves being passionate.
When I've seen them argue, it comes from a place of compassion, solving the problem together instead of fighting to win.
Over the years, I've seen their love develop.
I can't think of a trait in a partner that my friend would need that she doesn't have.

<!-- Conclusion: Why the marriage will work. -->

These two wonderful people are already *together* but I'm so excited to help them celebrate *tying the knot*.
They have deep and immense care in them.
Look at how they look at each other.
When Chris looks at Tori, she is the only thing that he sees.
When Tori looks at Chris, she sees him -- all of him -- for all he's worth.
I know that they'll have a long, happy, and healthy marriage.

*Toasts*
