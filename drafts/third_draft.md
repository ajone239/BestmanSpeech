<!--
    Things to remember:
    - your job is to explain why Chris and Tori will work out
        + This is supported by your descriptions of Chris's character
        + This is also supported by questionably sourced statements about Tori
    - no one give a heck about your stories
    - nostalgia needs to be in service of the main idea.
    - make sure that all the content of a paragraph helps its main idea
    - plan for the timing of a joke in the speech
    - things read differently than they sound
        + let points breath
    - keep it punchy
    - balance the punch with the breathing room
    - revise the conclusion to be sweet and indulgent but not to drag
