<!--
    Things to remember:
    - your job is to explain why Chris and Tori will work out
        + This is supported by your descriptions of Chris's character
        + This is also supported by questionably sourced statements about Tori
    - no one give a heck about your stories
    - nostalgia needs to be in service of the main idea.
    - make sure that all the content of a paragraph helps its main idea
    - plan for the timing of a joke in the speech
    - things read differently than they sound
        + let points breath
    - keep it punchy
    - balance the punch with the breathing room
    - revise the conclusion to be sweet and indulgent but not to drag
-->

<!--
    Intro:
    - How Chris and I met
    - We were rascals
    - make the really weird a kid thing
-->

It would be really hard for me to overstate how happy I am to be here.
At this wedding, I'm getting to see one of my oldest friends [ marry, enter the next phase of life ] someone he truly, deeply loves.
Chris and I have known each other for a long time.
We met in 4th grade English class.
I remember the teacher introducing him, "Hey class this is Chris Gerspacher. He is new to our school. He is from Florida."
The only impression of him that was in my nine year old mind was that he had a _really **weird** last name_.
<!-- small pause -->
Which _is_ something that I hope Tori knew before she entered into \* waves about \* this whole thing.

At any rate, Chris and I didn't become friends until months later.
Our class was reading Gary Paulsen's _Hatchet_: a story about a young man marooned in the Canadian wilderness.
Here I wish I could tell you that we bonded over the strong themes of self-reliance and deep reverence for nature.
But it wasn't.
No, what spawned nearly two decades of friendship between us was how stupid we thought the main character was for actually talking to a fire that he built.

<!-- <Optional Joke> -->
<!--
    Use this if you can
    a. tie it back in later
    b. it is funny
-->
<!-- make the fire seem important -->
He's so happy to have a fire, to cook, to warm, to sit, even to tend to.

<!-- say this tender -->
He tenderly says, "Hello, fire".

<!-- flip the delivery -->
Chris and I howled and cried with laughter.

<!-- pause for effect before saying it was moving -->

<!-- </Optional Joke> -->

It's actually a very moving part of the book if you ever check it out.

<!--
    Why Chris is a great guy:
    - Chris works hard.
    - Chris is a good friend.
    - Chris cares.
-->

<!-- TODO(ajone239): add a transition -->
That said, Chris and I have grown up quite a bit from mocking the books that teachers forced us to read.
Over the years, we did out best to not grow up, but we failed.
In that fight, I've picked up a few things on Chris.

<!-- Chris works hard. -->
Firstly, Chris knows the value of hard work.
Well, either that, or he doesn't know how to do anything but work hard.
He is diligent.
He is meticulous.
Never in school or our first job together did I see him shy away from what it took to meet his goals.

<!-- Chris is a good friend -->
Secondly, Chris is a great friend.
There hasn't been a time I've needed Chris that he wasn't there.
He has always been keen to lend an ear or advice to someone who needs it.
And, he always jumps to help when he can.

<!-- Chris cares. -->
Lastly, he has a big heart.
We share countless stories that I couldn't fit into this speech.
My first draft of this speech was 15 minutes long and I was being light with stories.
But, what these stories illuminate is a constant, deep running friendship that he and I share.
A friendship that you struggle to put words too, but you know exactly what it is and where it is.
I wish I could say that this friendship is unique to Chris and I.
However, everyone who knows Chris knows this in some capacity.
His company seems to inspire a deep connection in all the people he meets.

<!-- let this ride for a beat -->

<!--
    Enter Tori:
    - She appreciates him
        + She's one of the first examples I remember of someone really seeing Chris.
    - She deserves him
-->

Well onto the newly minted better half.
While I haven't know Tori for seventeen years, I have known her for the better part of a decade.
The whole time I have known her, she has loved Chris.
More than that, she really appreciates him for who he is.
Tori is one of the first examples I remember of someone _really seeing_ Chris.
When he is ranting about something _probably car related_, she listens with the patient joy enjoying your loved one's passion.
When he is hard at work, she appreciates not only the tire he's changing or sink he's fixing but his love for the craft.

<!-- man's best friend -->
She loves him for all his best traits.
She loves him for:
- his fervor
- his unconditional love
- his loyalty
- his companionship
For my money, Chris really is a man's best friend.
This is why I knew that they would do just fine when I learned that Tori was a professional dog sitter.

<!--
    Conclusion:
    - Love
    - Marriage
    - Pretty language
    - Be word man
-->

Bringing this all to a close, I'm so overjoyed to see these two come together.
Over the years, I've seen their relationship develop and deepen.
Of course, they have love between them.
More than that, the love between them comprises all the fundamentals:
- They have the dedication.
- They have the compassion.
- They have the mutual appreciation.
What they have will enhance the highs and dampen the lows.

Both people in this union are people with deep and immense care in them.
Far and away from that, these are two people who care for each other.
Watch how they look at one another.
When Chris looks at Tori, she is the only thing that he sees.
When Tori looks at Chris, she sees him -- all of him -- for all he's worth.
These two love each other, and I think they have great times ahead of them.
