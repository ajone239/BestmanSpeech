    Things to remember:
    - no one give a heck about your stories
    - your job is to explain why Chris and Tori will work out
    - nostalgia needs to be in service of the main idea.

<!--
    Intro:
    - How Chris and I met
    - We were rascals
-->

It would be really hard for me to overstate how happy I am to be here seeing one of my oldest friends with someone he truly, deeply loves.
Chris and I have known each other for a long time.
We met in the 4th grade in English class.
I remember the teacher introducing him to the class, "This is Chris Gerspacher. He is new to our school. He moved here from Florida."
My only thought of him in that moment was that he had a *really weird last name*.
Which is something I hope Tori knew before she entered into \* waves about \* this whole thing.

At any rate, Chris and I didn't become friends until a few months later.
Our class was reading Gary Paulsen's _Hatchet_; a story about about a young man marooned in the Canadian wilderness.
I wish I could tell you that he and I bonded over the themes of self reliance or the reverence for nature.

<!-- TODO(ajone239): Try this orally with and without it -->
No, what spawned nearly two decades of friendship between us was how stupid we thought the main character was for actually talking to a fire that he built.
<!-- VB: I would keep at least some of this; it feels too quick without it, but maybe you're pressed for time -->
This guy is *so happy* to have fire to cook by, to sleep by, to warm himself by that he calls it *his friend*.
He tenderly says, "Hello, Fire." <!-- VB: [especially this line, and then hit the "howled and cried" on the next line] -->
We howled and cried with laughter.
<!-- VB: Pause 2, 3, 4 -->
It's actually a very moving part of the book if you ever check it out.
<!-- if you include the bit above -->
I digress.

<!--
    Why Chris is a great guy:
    - Chris works hard.
    - Chris is a good friend.
    - Chris cares.
-->

I've picked up a few things on Chris over the years.

<!-- Chris works hard. -->
Firstly, Chris knows the worth and value of hard work.
Chris is an extremely hard worker.
He is diligent.
He is meticulous.
We didn't just go to school together; we also worked together for a few years.
He got me my first job, actually.
Be it a math problem or sanitizing the entire kitchen, I rarely have seen Chris waiver in the face of labor.

<!-- Chris is a good friend -->
Secondly, Chris is a tremendously loyal friend.
There hasn't been a time I've needed Chris that he wasn't there.
Sparing you the details, he helped me clean up 3 sewage leaks at the aforementioned kitchen job.
He has always been keen to lend an ear to anyone's troubles and help as he can.

<!-- Chris cares. -->
The last thing I know about Chris, he has a big heart on him.

We share countless stories that I couldn't fit into this speech, stories that illuminate a constant, deep-running friendship that he and I share.
Our deep friendship isn't unique for Chris.
Everyone who knows Chris knows in some capacity.
He seems to inspire deep connection with a lot of people.

<!--
    Enter Tori:
    - She appreciates him
        + She's one of the first examples I remember of someone really seeing Chris.
    - She deserves him
-->

Now I haven't known Tori for seventeen years, but I've known her for going on five or six.
The whole time I've known her she's loved Chris.
More than that, she appreciates him for who he is.
She really _sees_ him.
When Chris is ranting about something probably car related, Tori listens with a patient joy of hearing someone she loves being passionate.
When he is hard at work, she appreciates his ardor.

She loves him for his loyalty, his fervor, his unconditional love, and his companionship.
Chris really is a man's best friend.
Which is why I knew that they would do just fine whenever I learned Tori is a professional dog sitter.

<!--
    Conclusion:
    - Love
    - Marriage
    - Pretty language
    - Be word man
-->

Over the years, I've seen their relationship develop and deepen.
Of course, they have love between them.
More than that, the love between them comprises all the fundamentals.
They have the dedication.
They have the compassion.
They have the mutual appreciation.
What they have will enhance the highs and dampen the lows.

Bringing this all to a close, I'm so overjoyed to see these two come together.
Moreover, I'm very hopeful for them to have a long, happy, healthy marriage.
Both people in this union are people with deep and immense care in them.
Far and away from that, these are two people who care for each other.
Watch how they look at one another.
When Chris looks at Tori, she is the only thing that he sees.
When Tori looks at Chris, she sees him -- all of him -- for all he's worth.

These two love each other.
At that they both have lots of love to give.
I think they have great times ahead of them.
